Skeleton-skeleton
=================

A Gulp/LESS toolchain for Skeleton: _A Dead Simple, Responsive Boilerplate for Mobile-Friendly Development_

The Skeleton-skeleton is based on:

- **[Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com)**  
  Check out <http://getskeleton.com> for documentation and details.

- **[Skeleton on LESS](https://github.com/whatsnewsaes/Skeleton-less)**  
  Skeleton built with LESS for easier replacement of grid, color, and media queries.


### Why it's awesome

Skeleton is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more. 
- Minified, it's less than a kb
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework 


### Get started

You'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) installed.

Then do
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/orbitbot/Skeleton-skeleton.git
$ npm install
$ gulp
```
... and open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in a browser.
